\section{Introduction}
In this document, we will be presenting our concept for the implementation of group behavior within our internship project. Since group behavior and the deeper themes of friendship and group forming in humans are subjects that we have no experience in, we wanted to present our concept to you first to see whether our assumptions match reality. 


\newpage
\section{Friendship system}
In order to make our room filled with NPC's seem more like a room filled with humans, we intend to implement a friendship system. 

~\\
In real life, people with common interests, backgrounds and personalities tend to become friends. Since we have only personality (for now) to distinguish our NPC's, we will let NPC's select friends based on the 'Repulsion Theory' [1] which in its' most basic form states that we are usually repulsed of people when they have dissimilar attitudes to ours.

~\\
Within our system, we represent this by using the (accumulated) personality values of NPC's who could potentially become friends. We realize that the term 'friend' is not really appropriate here, since deep friendship can arguably be said to consist of more than just common personalities. Therefore, we will be using the term 'friends' to refer to NPC's who's (accumulated) personality values are in proportion, with some margin of error.

~\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{friendshipCreation}

~\\
We intend for this margin of error to be changeable by the user of our project in order to allow them to customize how easily they want friendships between NPC's to form.

\section{Informal groups}
As we mentioned earlier in our structure document, groups of people come in two distinct forms: Formal groups and informal groups.

~\\
Formal groups are usually found within the workplace, are created 'top-down', and are usually form edInformal groups are, as the name implies not directed or created by a formal body such as a board or a manager, but they form naturally as the human need for company arises, whether at the workplace or in a social setting. Since we do not intend to simulate a working environment in our project, we will be focusing on the latter form of groups. 

~\\
Informal groups can be loosely divided into two distinct categories: Interest groups and friendship groups.

~\\
Table 1: Differences between interest groups and friendship groups

~\\ 
\begin{tabularx}{0.7\textwidth}{ |X|X| }\hline
\textbf{Interest groups} & \textbf{Friendship groups} \\ \hline
Mutual goal & No real goal \\ \hline
Usually more hierarchic & More democratic \\ \hline
Higher purpose is more important than individual members & Group exists solely to satisfy personal member needs \\ \hline
Not necessarily common values and interests & Common ground \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}
~\\

~\\
Until we decide to implement some kind of goal seeking behavior within our NPC's (other than choosing actions that will show of their personality values) we will focus our attention on implementing a representation of friendship groups.  

\newpage
\section{An implementation of informal friendship groups}
The friendship system that we discussed earlier will be used as a bridge to introduce NPC's to groups. A group consists of NPC's who all have to share a friendship with at least a certain percentage of the NPC's in the group. 

~\\
For example:

~\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{group} 



~\\
If an NPC's loses friendship of enough group members, he/she will be removed from the group.

~\\


\newpage
A new NPC can join an existing group; Its' accumulated values are than tested against the mean\footnote{We use the mean instead of the average since this could lead to a group of egoists with one altruists having a group personality value that does not accurately represent the group members.} of all the accumulated personality values of all the group members.

~\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{groupJoining}


~\\
 If this returns a match within the earlier mentioned margin, the NPC is added to the group and the NPC gets the chance to become friends with each group member. If he/she becomes and stays friends with enough of the group members, the NPC gets to stay!

~\\
NPC's within a group are forced to only choose actions that conform to their groups' mean personality values instead of their own, whilst the accumulated values from these actions still add on to the NPC's personal accumulated values. This ensures that groups become tighter and tighter over time, unless NPC's are kicked out according to the earlier mentioned conditions.
